Cross-cultural communications 

Culture rooted in a person's life experience, mindset and self-recognition, psychology identification, the challenges of communication barriers were raised especially in the globalization world, peoples from different countries and backgrounds may have strong prejudice against the behavior or habits which were enforced by the media or particular experience which may be mistakenly used as representative of the whole country.

It is quite difficult, sometimes, to understand each other, the misunderstanding caused mistrust and fears of each other when there is conflict of interest, eventually the gap between people with different mindset is unbelievably huge to leap over.  

Behind the culture gap, the most difficult part is related with interest conflict and self-respect, when the conflict is related to the emotional crisis between those parties, where have dominant sides and weak sides, the psychological pressure and energy will make the logical sense disappear. Especially when two sides have prejudice and strong beliefs which have conflict, the culture difference will not be easily understood.

Route lost theory

In daily life, there are several cases are common for human beings, for example if you feel tired at work with less payments, and you prefer a better and easier life, then naturally you will try to make more money, after you are inspired by the vision to be rich, you make a great plan and work harder to achieve it, however during the long run, you find other pursuits like social class and power, you worked overnight, have no time to enjoy with your family, finally you forgot the original reason, make money to live better with your family.  

That happens also in many places even for the experienced and professional men and women, you pick up a phone to fix an issue, however you may lost in other ways not relevant with the original issue.  

The reason why this happened is because the mind mapping of human beings is not always logical and consistent, controversially, we are quite easy to addict by fractional information or things. Look at yourself in the daily life,when you are web surfing by iPhone or computer, guess how many different webpages you have be redirected.   

The attention is easy to be distracted, consistent logical thinking is hard to maintain, emotional influence, complexities and multi factors are the main reason for the route lost.   

You start the road with a destination, but on the road you find the flowers are enjoyable, or a charming lady who adore you, then you forget the destination and the time tables, your great plan of life.  

The facts of non-reliable behavior caused business management more supervision cost, to keep staffs working in schedule, meet the deadline, achieve the target. The executives appraisals on the book "a letter to Garcia", is a signal that management emphasizes the importance to deliver the commitment, not distracted or lost on the way.  

Different cultures have different propensities of the route lost. Ordinarily in many people's points of view, German guys are more reliable and consistent to follow rules and guidelines than some other nationalities.  

To keep yourself on track, it is useful to write down your vision, target with criteria , milestone and deadline, visional notes can be quite helpful to remind you on the way with plenty of meats and flowers.
